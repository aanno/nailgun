/**
 * Provides some nice command-line stack operations. This nail must have the aliases "push" and
 * "pop" associated with it in order to work properly.
 *
 * <p>If the "push" command is used, each argument on the command line is pushed onto the stack (in
 * order) and the program returns immediately.
 *
 * <p>If the "pop" command is used, the top item on the stack is displayed to the client's stdout.
 * If the stack is empty, the client will block until another process calls push. If the nailgun
 * server is shutdown while pop is blocking, pop will cause the client to exit with exit code 1.
 * This is thread-safe: you can have multiple clients waiting on "pop" and only one of them
 * (determined by the VM and the magic of synchronization) will receive any one pushed item.
